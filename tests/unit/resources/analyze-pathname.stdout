Initialized music similarity method: timbre
~~~
A timbre only music similarity measure based 'mandelellis'. It
improves the basic measure in multiple ways to achieve superior
results:
We compute a single Gaussian representation from the songs
using 25 MFCCs. The similarity between two tracks is computed
with the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The Similarities are
normalized with Mutual Proximity:
